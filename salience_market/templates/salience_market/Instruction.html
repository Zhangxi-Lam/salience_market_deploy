<h4>Basic Idea</h4>

<p>
In this experiment, you will interact with other traders in 8 trading periods, each lasting approximately 4 minutes.
The traders remain the same in each trading period, but are randomly regrouped between trading periods.
In each trading period, you will simultanously trade two risky assets (labelled as Asset A and B) with other traders, using computerized trading screens.
The return of the assets depends on the state of the world. There are multiple (2 or 3) possible states.
In each trading period, traders are informed publicly of the number of assets, the number of all possible states,
the probability of each state, and the return of the assets at each state.
</p>

<p>
During each trading period, the traders trade under the same state of the world but do NOT know the true state.
At the end of the trading period, the computer tosses a 10-sided dice, and randomly assigns the true state of the world depending on the probability of each state.
Your payoff in each trading period depends on the number of each type of assets you own and the true state of the world.
For example, suppose that there are two states: state 1 with probability 40% and state 2 with probability 60%.
You do NOT know which state will become the true state during the trading period.
At the end of the trading period, the true state will be randomly determined based on the probabilities of the two states.
Since the computer uses a 10-sided fair dice, then throwing 1-4 means state 1 is chosen, while throwing 5-10 means state 2 is chosen.
</p>


<h4>How to Trade</h4>

<p>
When you enter a trading period, you will start to interact with the user interface.
The figure below shows an example.
<b>Please be aware that the example figures (this one and the other one below) only show you what the user interface looks like,
and does NOT indicate what game strategy you should use.</b>
</p>

<img src="{% static 'salience_market/ui_decision.png' %}" width="100%" height="auto"/>

<p>
The user interface can be divided into multiple boxes:
</p>

<p>
There is a timer on the top counting down the time left.
Below the timer, you can see the information about the trading period, including the current trading period number,
the total number of traders, the number of possible state of the world, the probability of each state,
and the return for each asset as each state. Please read the information carefully before you start to trade.
You will also see a notice if the current trading period is a pracice period.
Your final payoff will NOT be selected from a practice period.
</p>

<p>
Below the trading period information, you can see the trading boxes for each asset, respectively.
Each asset has its own trading box. In the example figure, since there are two assets A and B, you can see the trading boxes for Asset A on the left,
and the boxes for Asset B on the right. In each trading box,

<ul>
  <li>
    "Bids" box shows the prices at which traders are offering to buy units of the assets.
    Bids are ordered from high to low since the highest bids are the most attractive offers to other traders.
  </li>
  <li>
    "Asks" box shows the prices at which sellers are offering to sell units.
    Likewise, asks are ordered from low to high since the lowest is the most attractive offer to other traders.
  </li>
  <li>
    If two bids/asks have the same price, the earlier offers will be displayed above the later ones.
    A bid/ask with a red "X" button on the right indicates your own offer, and you can cancel your offer by pressing the "X" button.
  </li>
  <li>
    "Trades" box in the middle shows the successful trading history in the market with the most recent trades on the top.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You can submit a bid (buy offer) by typing in your price in the “Bids” box and clicking the "Buy" button.
Likewise, to offer to sell a unit, you type in the price in the “Asks” box and click Enter "Sell".
You can place multiple bids and asks at the same time.
If your bid is higher than the best ask, then you will immediately buy a unit at that best ask.
Similarly, entering an ask below the best bid held by someone else amounts to accepting that best bid.
You can also directly accept someone else’s bid or ask by double clicking on it, and then clicking Accept in the pop-up window.
</p>

<p>
To conclude, you can buy a unit of asset by submitting your bid or accepting others' ask.
You can sell a unit of asset by submitting your ask or accepting others' bid.
In general, it is more profitable to buy low and sell high.
You should also NOT buy an asset when its price exceeds its maximum possible return,
or sell an asset when its price is below its minimum possible return.
Check the trading window and see whether your buy price seem low, and your sell price seem high compared to the other prices (in white) this period.
</p>

<p>
The trader information box on the bottom left tells you your current cash holding and asset holding.
The box will update whenever your make an action.
You will start with some units of assets and some cash at the beginning of each trading period.
The settled cash refers to the cash you own at hand,
the available cash refers to the cash available to buy (Settled Cash - Your Total Bids).
For each asset row,

<ul>
  <li>the Available column refers to the number of assets available to trade (Settled - Offered);</li>
  <li>the Settled column refers to the number of assets you currently own.</li>
  <li>the Requested column refers to the total number of bids;</li>
  <li>the Offered column refers to the total number of asks.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The log box on the bottom right records all your actions and will tell you if you made mistakes,
such as trying to sell an asset when your currently hold zero units of that asset.
</p>



<h4>Payment</h4>
<p>
After each trading period, you will see a result page that summarize your actions and performance in the previous trading period.
The result page reveals the true state of the world and remind you of your final asset holding.
The page also shows the total payoff for this trading period. After the result page, all traders go on together to the next trading period.
</p>

<p>
The payoff from trading in each period will be your remaining cash + your earning from your final asset holding - your initial cash endowment.
The figure below shows an example of the result page, and you can clearly see the payoff you get in this trading period.
From the figure, you can see that the true state of the world is "state 3" for both assets, your remaining cash is 1000 points,
the cash endowment is 1000 points,
and you own 5 unit of Asset A which pays 80 points per unit under state 3. You also own 5 units of Asset B that pays 120 per unit under state 3.
So your final payoff is 1000 + 80*5 + 120*5 - 1000 = 1000 points.

<p>
At the end of the experiment, one non-practice trading period will be randomly chosen by the computer,
and your final payoff from this experiment is your payoff at that trading period (after converted to US dollar), plus your show-up fee.
So your objective is to try to maximize your payoff at every non-practice trading period.
</p>

{% if state_independent %}
<p>
<b>As an additional rule for today's experiment, the state of the world for each asset is drawn independently. That is, it is possible that the assets have different states.
For example, Asset A may be at state 1 while Asset B may be at state 3.</b>

If you are ready for the experiment, please raise your hand in the chat room or inform the experimenter. The experiment starts when everyone is ready.
