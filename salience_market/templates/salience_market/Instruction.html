<h4>Basic Idea</h4>

<p>
In this experiment, you will interact with other traders in multiple (12-18) trading periods, each lasting approximately 3 minutes.
The traders remain the same in each trading period, but are randomly regrouped between trading periods.
In each trading period, you will trade two risky assets (labelled as Asset A and B) with other traders, using computerized trading screens.
The return of the assets depends on the state of the world. There are multiple (2 or 3) possible states.
In each trading period, traders are informed publicly of the number of assets, the number of states,
the probability of each state, and the return of the assets at each state.
Before each trading period, the computer tosses a 10-sided dice, and assigns the state of the world depending on the probability of each state.
All traders trade under the same state of the world, but no one knows the true state of the world until the end of the trading period.
Your payoff in each trading period depends on the number of each type of assets you own and the true state of the world.
</p>



<h4>How to Trade</h4>

<p>
When you enter a trading period, you will start to interact with the user interface.
The figure below shows an example.
</p>

<img src="{% static 'salience_market/ui_decision.png' %}" width="100%" height="auto"/>

<p>
The user interface can be divided into multiple boxes:
</p>

<p>
There is a timer on the top counting down the time left.
Below the timer, you can see the information about the trading period, including the current trading period number,
the total number of traders, the number of possible state of the world, the probability of each state,
and the return for each asset as each state. Please read the information carefully before you start to trade.
You will also see a notice if the current trading period is a pracice period.
Your final payoff will NOT be selected from a practice period.
</p>

<p>
Below the trading period information, you can see the trading boxes for each asset, respectively.
Each asset has its own trading box. In the example figure, since there are two assets A and B, you can see the trading boxes for Asset A on the left,
and the boxes for Asset B on the right. In each trading box,

<ul>
  <li>
    "Bids" box shows the prices at which traders are offering to buy units of the assets.
    Bids are ordered from high to low since the highest bids are the most attractive offers to other traders.
  </li>
  <li>
    "Asks" box shows the prices at which sellers are offering to sell units.
    Likewise, asks are ordered from low to high since the lowest is the most attractive offer to other traders.
  </li>
  <li>
    If two bids/asks have the same price, the earlier offers will be displayed above the later ones.
    A bid/ask with a red "X" button on the right indicates your own offer, and you can cancel your offer by pressing the "X" button.
  </li>
  <li>
    "Trades" box in the middle shows the successful trading history in the market with the most recent trades on the top.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You can submit a bid (buy offer) by typing in your price in the “Bids” box and clicking the "Buy" button.
Likewise, to offer to sell a unit, you type in the price in the “Asks” box and click Enter "Sell".
You can place at most 1 bid and 1 ask at the same time. If you enter a new bid or ask, it will replace your old offer.
If your bid is higher than the best ask, then you will immediately buy a unit at that best ask.
Similarly, entering an ask below the best bid held by someone else amounts to accepting that best bid.
You can also directly accept someone else’s bid or ask by double clicking on it, and then clicking Accept in the pop-up window.
</p>

<p>
It is more profitable to buy low and sell high.
Check the trading window and see whether your buy price seem low, and your sell price seem high compared to the other prices (in white) this period.
</p>

<p>
The trader information box on the bottom left tells you your current cash holding and asset holding.
The box will update whenever your make an action.
You will start with some units of assets and some cash at the beginning of each trading period.
The settled cash refers to the cash you own at hand,
the available cash refers to the cash available to buy (Settled - Total Bids).
For each asset row,

<ul>
  <li>the Available column refers to the number of assets available to trade (Settled - Offered);</li>
  <li>the Settled column refers to the number of assets you currently own.</li>
  <li>the Requested column refers to the total number of bids;</li>
  <li>the Offered column refers to the total number of asks.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The log box on the bottom right records all your actions and will tell you if you made mistakes,
such as trying to sell an asset when your currently hold zero units of that asset.
</p>



<h4>Payment</h4>
<p>
After each trading period, you will see a result page that summarize your actions and performance in the previous trading period.
The result page reveals the true state of the world and remind you of your final asset holding.
The page also shows the total payoff for this trading period. After the result page, all traders go on together to the next trading period.
</p>

<p>
The payoff from trading in each period will be your remaining cash, plus your earning from your final asset holding.
The figure below shows an example of the result page, and you can clearly see the payoff you get in this trading period.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the experiment, one non-practice trading period will be randomly chosen by the computer,
and your final payoff from this experiment is your payoff at that trading period, plus your show-up fee.
