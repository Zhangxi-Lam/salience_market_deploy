<p>
Welcome, and thank you for participating!
</p>

<p>
From now until the end of the experiment, please stay focused on the task at hand, as your payment highly depends on your performance in the experiment.
To respect other participants, please do not eat, play, chat, or leave the room during the experiment.
If you need to drink water or use your cellphone, please only do so when necessary.
If you have any questions, please send the host a private message and the host will answer your question.
Please also remember to open the session link with Chrome because other browsers may cause problems. The experiment lasts about an hour.
</p>

<p>
During the experiment, you will earn points in each trading period.
At the end of the experiment, one trading period will be randomly chosen, from which your points will be converted to US dollars at the rate of 150:1.
That is, 150 points give you 1 US dollar at the end of the experiment.
You are guaranteed a show-up fee of $4.00 but can earn considerably more.
